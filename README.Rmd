# BaseSet

The goal of BaseSet is to facilitate working with sets

## Installation

You can install the released version of BaseSet from [Github](https://github.com/llrs/BaseSet) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("llrs/BaseSet")
```
 
## Examples

```{r include=FALSE}
library("BaseSet")
```

To work with sets we need to have the relations between the elements and the sets:

```{r TidySet}
relations <- data.frame(sets = c(rep("A", 5), "B", "B"), 
                        elements = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "a", "f"),
                        fuzzy = runif(7))
a <- tidySet(relations = relations)
nSets(a)
a
```

```{r}
b <- union(a, "A", "B", "C")
nSets(b)
```
