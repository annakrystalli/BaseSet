# BaseSet

The goal of BaseSet is to facilitate working with sets

## Installation

You can install the released version of BaseSet from [Github](https://github.com/llrs/BaseSet) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("llrs/BaseSet")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, error=TRUE}
library("BaseSet")
set(c("a", "b", "c"))
set(c("a", "b", "a"))
```
We can calculate the size of the sets, the length is reported when printing the object:
```{r}
a <- set(c("a" = 0.5, "b" = 0.2, "c" = 0.3, "d" = 0.5))
b <- set(letters[1:4])
a
b
length(a) # this is automatically reported
length(b) # this is automatically reported
set_size(a)
set_size(b)
```

```{r}
SC <- setCollection(c(a, b))
incidence(SC)
```

A new way mixing S4 but following tidyverse style:
```{r TidySet}
relations <- data.frame(sets = c(rep("a", 5), "b"), 
                        elements = letters[seq_len(6)])
tidySet(relations = relations)
```
